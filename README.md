# Image Processing API

This project provides a RESTful API for image upload, retrieval, and conversion. It's built using Spring Boot and offers various endpoints for handling image-related operations.

## Features

- Upload single or multiple images
- Retrieve images by ID
- Convert images to different formats
- Convert uploaded files to different formats without persistence
- Retrieve information about all stored images

## Assumptions

1. This is a Spring Boot Example Application.
2. The application uses a database to store image metadata and binary data.
3. The server has sufficient storage capacity to handle uploaded images.
4. Users have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the file system.
5. The application runs in a secure environment with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place.
6. The maximum file size for uploads is configured appropriately in the application properties.

## Supported Image Formats

The API supports a wide range of image formats for upload, retrieval, and conversion:

* .jpg / .jpeg (JPEG)
* .png (Portable Network Graphics)
* .gif (Graphics Interchange Format)
* .bmp (Bitmap Image File)
* .tiff / .tif (Tagged Image File Format)
* .webp (WebP)
* .ppm (Portable Pixmap Format)
* .pgm (Portable Graymap Format)
* .pbm (Portable Bitmap Format)
* .sr (Sun Raster)
* .ras (Sun Raster, alternative extension)
* .jp2 (JPEG 2000)
* .exr (OpenEXR HDR imaging format)
* .hdr (Radiance HDR imaging format)

- **Parameters:**
    - `id`: Integer ID of the image to retrieve
- **Response:** Image file

### 3. Convert Stored Image

- **URL:** `/api/images/convert-image`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameters:**
    - `id`: Integer ID of the image to convert
    - `fmt`: String representing the target format (e.g., "png", "jpg", "gif")
- **Response:** Converted image file

### 4. Convert Uploaded File

- **URL:** `/api/images/convert-file`
- **Method:** GET
- **Parameters:**
    - `file`: Image file to convert (MultipartFile)
    - `fmt`: String representing the target format (e.g., "png", "jpg", "gif")
- **Response:** Converted image file

### 5. Get All Images Information

- **URL:** `/api/images/get-all`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:** List of ResponseObjects containing information about all stored images

## Usage Examples

### Uploading an Image

```bash
curl -X POST -F "files=@/path/to/image.jpg" http://localhost:8080/api/images/upload
```

### Retrieving an Image

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/images/retrieve?id=1 --output retrieved_image.jpg
```

### Converting a Stored Image

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/images/convert-image?id=1&fmt=png --output converted_image.png
```

### Converting an Uploaded File

```bash
curl -X GET -F "file=@/path/to/image.jpg" http://localhost:8080/api/images/convert-file?fmt=png --output converted_image.png
```

### Getting All Images Information

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/images/get-all
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes for error responses:

- 400 Bad Request: For invalid input
- 404 Not Found: When a requested resource is not found
- 500 Internal Server Error: For unexpected server-side errors


## Production Deployment Considerations

To deploy this application to a production environment, several modifications and best practices should be implemented:

### 1. Security
#### Authentication and Authorization
- Implement a robust authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
- Add role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain endpoints.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse.

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- Use secure file storage solutions for uploaded images (e.g., AWS S3, GCP cloud storage etc. with proper access controls).

### 2. Scalability and Performance

#### Auto-scaling: Use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes for automatic scaling.
#### Load Balancing: Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application.
#### Caching: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times. Use CDN for serving static assets and potentially for caching converted images.

### 3. Containerization
- Dockerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size.
- Implement health checks in your Dockerfile.
- Use docker-compose for local development and testing.

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging (e.g., using ELK stack or Cloud-based solutions).
- Set up application performance monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog).
- Implement custom metrics for business-critical operations.
- Set up alerts for anomalies and errors.

### 5. Database Considerations
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Implement database replication for read-heavy workloads.
- Consider using a managed database service for easier maintenance and scaling.

### 6. CI/CD
- Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform for managing cloud resources.
- Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies for zero-downtime updates.

### 7. Resilience and Fault Tolerance
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls.
- Use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- Implement graceful degradation strategies for non-critical features.

### 8. API Versioning and Documentation
- Implement API versioning to manage changes without breaking existing clients.
- Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for API documentation.

### 9. Performance Optimization
- Optimize image processing algorithms for better performance.
- Implement asynchronous processing for time-consuming operations.
- Use lazy loading techniques where appropriate.

## Future Work
The following features are being considered for future development:
- Image compression
- Image rotation
- Thumbnail creation
- Cropping
- Resizing
- Applying filters (e.g., grayscale, sepia)
- Watermarking
- Brightness and contrast adjustment
- Red-eye removal
- Image sharpening and blurring
- Adding text overlays to images
- Image flipping (horizontal/vertical)
- Noise reduction
- Color balance adjustment
- Image stitching (creating panoramas)
- Batch processing of multiple images
- Extracting image metadata (EXIF information)
- Creating image collages
- Generating QR codes from images
- Image histogram equalization
- Object recognition (identifying objects within an image)
- Object identification (providing detailed information about recognized objects)

These potential features aim to expand the capabilities of the Image Processing API, providing a more comprehensive set of tools for manipulating and enhancing images.
